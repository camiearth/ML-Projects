Using the Dataset
To use the dataset, first navigate to the NN_MNIST folder and download the train and test files.

Opening the Notebook in Colab
To open the notebook in Google Colab, simply open the file Notebook (kNN).ipynb. Click on this file to open it in your web browser.
Next, click on the "Open in Colab" button located at the top of the notebook. This will open the notebook in a new tab in Google Colab.
Once the notebook is open in Colab, you can run the cells by clicking on them and then clicking the "Run" button that appears on the left-hand side of the cell. 
That's it! 
If you want to play with it just make a copy of the notebook and you should now be able to use the MNIST dataset and the NN_MNIST notebook in your machine learning projects.
