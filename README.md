# ML-Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I have been working for fun and learning, 
using various frameworks and python as programming language. 
Each project is contained within its own directory, and includes a README file 
describing the project very briefly and how to run it.

The projects cover a range of topics in machine learning, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, 
deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. 
They are intended to serve as examples and learning resources for those 
interested in the field of machine learning.
Each project is run in Google Colab and may have its own set of instructions and requirements, 
which should also be included in the README file. 

Feel free to explore the projects, modify the code to suit your needs, 
and use them as a starting point for your own machine learning projects. 
If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue in the repository.

Cheers (:
